# ATM-Transactions

In this project, I leveraged a dataset of ATM transactions from Kaggle and employed SQL and Power BI for in-depth analysis. The insights gleaned from the data revealed several noteworthy patterns. Firstly, the equal distribution of male and female customers was observed and insights into transaction frequency across age groups, common transaction types, busiest hours, and monthly patterns for various states were uncovered. Despite only 11% of total customers using ATMs in Enugu state, it exhibited the highest transaction activity among all states. On the contrary, while about 86% of customers used ATMs in Lagos, the state faced low ATM activity, indicating potential issues of reduced availability and convenience for customers. Additionally, the project identified that customers with labor-intensive professions were comparatively less.

Furthermore, the analysis highlighted Kano's longer average transaction duration, indicating potential congestion and wait times at ATMs. Strategies were proposed, such as increasing the number of ATMs, upgrading to more efficient models, ensuring regular maintenance, and educating customers for enhanced efficiency and satisfaction. The study also addressed the comparatively low utilization rate in Lagos, recommending measures like strategic ATM relocation, offering customer incentives, and tailoring services based on customer preferences. 

The findings presented actionable recommendations to optimize ATM services, improve customer experience, and address specific challenges faced by different regions, contributing to overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
